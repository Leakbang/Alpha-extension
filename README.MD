## Installation
Download it for Firefox from here: [Mozilla Link]

## Build from source
No special procedure is required. Simply pack `manifest.json`, `index.html`, and the `assets` folder into a zip file and load it into Firefox via the `about:debugging` page by loading it as a temporary addon.  
Alternatively it is possible to load only the `manifest.json` file.
